                        <h2>Narrative</h2>
                        <p>There has always been a buzz about the career paths IITians choose after they graduate, and numerous questions have been raised and accusations been flung (looking at you, Mr. Katju!). We asked the graduating batch their plans for the immediate as well as the long -term future:</p>
                        <h3>
                          What they’re doing:

                            <li>
                              <p>
                                About 29% of the respondents said they have entered the field of technology/engineering or research for their first jobs; while an additional 22% said they have opted for higher studies. The ‘non-core’ fields consultancy and finance made 16% and 12% of the sample respectively. Other options like entrepreneurship and government (politics) took up 5% of the sample each. 5% of the graduating batch said they had little idea on what to do next, a perennial issue plaguing many graduating students since time immemorial.
                              </p>

                              Following the previous question, we asked the students about their plans 5 years after graduation, and noticed an interesting shift in choices. Respondents aspiring to venture into entrepreneurship rose to 19%, while those wishing to continue in technology/engineering shrank to 17%. Close to 18% of respondents said they wished to pursue higher studies some time in the future, if not immediately. 14% of the respondents wanted to enter politics or a government job. A poignant observation was that about 14% of respondents were confused about their plans in their career.

The CAT and GMAT exams for management prospects saw interest from 98 and 74 respondents respectively. 68 students said they would appear for the Civil Services exams.

Of these 247, 98 (~40%) students will work in Mumbai itself. Other popular cities of inhabitation after graduation are Bangalore (21%) and Delhi (17%). Another 17% is comprised by students who will live in Hyderabad, Pune, Chennai or other metropolitan cities.                          </p>
