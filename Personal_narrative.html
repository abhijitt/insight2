                          Majority of our respondents (91.5%) were male whereas only 8.5% were female, a not-so-surprising statistic, since gender diversity in IITs has been a topic of discussion for a while.
                        </p>
                      </li>

                          An overwhelming majority of the respondents (~96%) identified themselves as straight when they joined IIT. After 4 years at IIT, 93% of respondents identify themselves as straight. Although this change is quite small, it can be interpreted as a good sign, that of an accepting atmosphere at IIT which is helped by the presence of Saathi on campus.

                          More than a third of students grew up in Tier 2 cities (37%) followed by students who grew up in Tier 1 Metros (30%). Students who came from towns comprised 26% whereas 6% said they grew up in villages.

                          Around 40% said they knew a few people from the opposite sex but only as acquaintances. 30% replied that they were close friends with a few people from the opposite sex. 15% respondents had many acquaintances from the opposite sex, while 8% said they had no acquaintances at all from the opposite sex. 8% said they had more friends from the opposite sex than their own.

                          A majority of respondents felt marriage was far away as 40% had marriage on their plans only after 5 years. A sizable number, 30% said they had no clue when they would get married whereas 20% felt marriage was on the cards within 3-5 years. 6% had no plans of getting married at all.
